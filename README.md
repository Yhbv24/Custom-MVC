## About

The purpose of this project was to create an MVC framework from scratch.

## To Use

To use this project, you will need to install Composer if you haven't yet. See more here https://getcomposer.org for more information.

Once you have composer installed, run `composer install`, which will install the required dependencies for this project.

You will also need to set up a database for this project, and I recommend using MAMP. See more here https://www.mamp.info/en/. You can customize the database as you wish, just make sure to update the `Database.php` file and other models.
